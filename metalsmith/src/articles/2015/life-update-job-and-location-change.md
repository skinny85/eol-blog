There have been some very big changes in my life recently.

I have moved to Madrid, Spain, to go work for [Amazon](http://amazom.com).

That doesn't mean there's something wrong with [Pragmatists](http://pragmatists.pl) - my previous employer. Quite the opposite, in fact. I still think it's a fantastic place to work, and a unique company with a culture that sets it apart in many ways. The level of developer skill found among it's employees is also higher than anywhere I've seen. The reasons for my departure are strictly my own - I was looking to make major changes in my life, and not only in the work department. Obviously, moving from Poland to Spain is such a change, and not one I could make while being a Pragmatist (without becoming a remote employee, for which I'm not ready, at least as of now). I know saying "It's not you, it's me" when ending a relationship is a clich√©, but in this case I promise it's true.

The move across countries has been quite challenging, and in many ways it still hasn't been completed. Having said that, I don't regret a second of it. I'm incredibly excited about the opportunity at Amazon, and can't wait to find out how it turns out. For the first time in a while, I can honestly say that I have no idea what will my future look like. It's a little scary, but also very, very exhilarating.

And there are some perks to the new job already - I don't remember having this sort of view from my office in Poland (note the mountains in the distance):
