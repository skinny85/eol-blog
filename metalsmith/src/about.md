My name is Adam Ruka, and 'End of Line' is my blog about programming.

I'm a full-stack web developer working for <a href="http://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. I'm a huge proponent of writing clean code, and I'm interested in everything that will help me achieve that - so things like Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design and functional programming I hold in very high esteem. I also like to dabble in DevOps and various "meta-development" topics like build systems, Continuous Integration, compilers, deployment automation and sometimes even Linux kernel hacking.
I'm <a href="https://github.com/skinny85" target="_blank">skinny85 on GitHub</a>.

I'm originally from Poland, currently based in Seattle, WA. If you want to get in touch with me, I'm on <a href="https://twitter.com/adam_ruka" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamruka" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
