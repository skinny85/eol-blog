summary: Information about the author of this blog

My name is Adam Ruka, and 'End of Line' is my blog about programming.

I'm a full-stack developer working for [Amazon](http://amazon.com). I'm a huge proponent of writing clean code, and I'm interested in everything that will help me achieve that -- so things like Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design and functional programming I hold in very high esteem. I also like to dabble in DevOps and various "meta-development" topics like build systems, Continuous Integration, compilers, deployment automation and sometimes even Linux kernel hacking.
I'm [skinny85 on GitHub](https://github.com/skinny85).

I'm originally from Poland, currently based in Seattle, WA. If you want to get in touch with me, I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adam_ruka) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamruka).

All opinions shared on this blog are my own,
